# 🧠 Hate Speech Classifier – NLP Project using DistilRoBERTa

This project presents a high-accuracy Natural Language Processing (NLP) system for classifying hate speech using transformer models. Built with PyTorch and fine-tuned on a large-scale social media dataset, this model enables real-time prediction via an interactive Streamlit web interface.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🏗 **Model**: Fine-tuned **DistilRoBERTa** using PyTorch.
- 📊 **Accuracy**: Achieved **87.4% test accuracy** on a balanced dataset of over **700,000 labeled samples**.
- 🔬 **Benchmarking**: Compared and analyzed 5+ transformer models including **RoBERTa**, **DistilBERT**, and **BERT-base**, evaluating overfitting, training time, and accuracy trade-offs.
- 🌐 **Deployment**: Developed an intuitive **Streamlit web interface** for live text classification of user input as either **"Hateful"** or **"Non-Hateful"**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, Transformers (HuggingFace), Streamlit
- **Model**: DistilRoBERTa (fine-tuned)
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (deployed as an interactive UI)
- **Dataset**: >700k social media posts, pre-balanced for binary classification
